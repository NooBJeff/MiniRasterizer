# Mini Game Engine

A real time, interactive, single-threaded minial game engine.

Due to the complexity of a "real" game engine and the fact that I was only a little more than one year into computer sciecne at the time coding this, this project, failed expectation. It's more like an **interative 3D model viewer** at the end.

## Features
1. Custom fixed rendering pipeline with custom linear algebra library
2. OBJ format model loader
2. Texture mapping for models
3. Basic input management
4. Basic scene management

## Issues/Todos:
1. Texture mapping percision
2. Lack of lighting/shadows

## To Compile and Run

Open this project with Visual Studio (2015 or newer), compile with the built-in compiler.
