# Mini Game Engine
A toy project for me to practice the fixed render pipeline and event-driven programming.  
College project, terrible coding manner    

## _Todo Lists:(DEAD PROJECT)_
0. ~~Switch to shared pointers~~
1. ~~Accuracy issues~~
2. ~~Triangle Clipping (IMPORTANT)~~
3. ~~Mutli-thread optimization~~

### -What is this ?

For detailed information please consult the __Documentation.md__

A dull implement of the so-called "rasterization" process, which is widely used in almost all the modern game engines to render image.

### -How to compile and run ?  
__Make sure the Rasterizer.exe is placed under the same directory as the "Resources"" folder, or images will not be found or even worse__  

I'm using Visual Studio 2015 Community, that's the only IDE which can compile these codes.
