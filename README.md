### -What is this ?

For detailed information please consult the __Documentation.md__

A dull implement of the Rasterization method, which is widely used in almost all the modern game engines to generate image.

### -How to compile and run ?  
__Make sure the Rasterizer.exe is placed under the same directory as the "Resources"" folder, or images will not be found or even worse__  

I'm using Visual Studio 2015 Community to make this project, so Visual Studio is highly recommended for compile work.  

Please note that this software runs on Windows Operating System ONLY, since its using Win API to create the GUI.
