# MiniRasterizer
MiniRasterizer For Personal Education Purpose, feel free to use in any way you want.  
Student's work, terrible coding manner  
Open for all feedback
  
__Under Development...__  

### _Incoming New Features:_
1. ( NULL )  

_Still working on adding all the basic functions_  
_ETA one week_  

## -What is this ?

A Graphic Engine with minimum functions...  
_or_  
A dull implement of the Rasterization method, which is widely used in almost all the modern game engines to generate image.

## -How to compile and run ?  
__Make Sure the Rasterizer.exe is placed in the same folder with the "ImageResources"" folder, or Images will not be found__  

I'm using Visual Studio 2015 Community to make this project, so Visual Studio is highly recommended for compile work.  

Please note that this software runs on Windows Operating System ONLY, since its using Win API to create the GUI.
