### -What is this ?

For detailed information please consult the __Documentation.md__

A dull implement of the so-called "Rasterization" method, which is widely used in almost all the modern game engines to render image.

### -How to compile and run ?  
__Make sure the Rasterizer.exe is placed under the same directory as the "Resources"" folder, or images will not be found or even worse__  

I'm using Visual Studio 2015 Community, that's the only IDE which can compile these codes.
